<h1>Area of Study</h1>

<p>As a first year master's student, I'm definitely a beginner in this concept of research. With that said, I'm incredibly passionate about my area of study and I've been digging into this long before I started grad school. The areas below represent high level topics within my area of research.</p>

<h2>Data for Social Good</h2>

<p>I focus on the application of big (or medium) data to the area of international development. This data can come from a number of sources including Twitter, metadata from sites like Wikipedia or Google, telecom call detail records, and sensor networks. In the future we'll hopefully see more data from devices like water pumps and cookstoves.</p>

<p>Just like any technology, the business world has taken advantage of these types of data to better understand their customers needs and desires. This proven track record indicates that NGOs and governmental organizations can potentially gain insight from these same sources of data (and new ones). This data can allow social service organizations to obtain more real-time insight into people's situations around the world.</p>

<h2>Engagement with World Events</h2>

<p>As an offshoot of the <i>Data for Social Good</i> area, I'm interested in examining these same data sources in order to determine how individuals around the world engage or do not engage with world events. This area of interest has a strong connection with information overload and the changing landscape of journalism. I'm interested in looking at the reasons that Americans (or citizens of other Global North countries) choose to engage or choose note to engage with news sources to understand events occurring around the world.<p>
