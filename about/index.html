		<p>I love technology but hate injustice. I study ways that technology can help solve the world's most pressing problems at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu">University of Colorado</a>'s <a href="http://atlas.colorado.edu">ATLAS Institute</a>. I do research with <a href="http://epic.cs.colorado.edu">Project EPIC</a>, and I also consult for several mission-driven organizations to help them leverage and protect data. I was a <a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu">Data Science for Social Good</a> Fellow at the University of Chicago, and formerly managed technology at the <a href="http://www.aidschicago.org">AIDS Foundation of Chicago</a>.</p>

		<p>Across all <a href="/research">my work</a>, I try to find ways to better understand people in order to help facilitate a more fair and just world.</p>

		<p>I live in the beautiful state of Colorado with my amazing wife and incredibly drooly cat. I love finding efficient ways to address inefficiencies. I love spending the day with a cup of coffee learning about anything and everything. Sometimes I think I should go outside more.</p>
