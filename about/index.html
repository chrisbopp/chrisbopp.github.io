<h1>Understand Me</h1>

<p class="lead">I use technology and data for social good.</p>

<p>I love technology but hate injustice. I study ways that technology can help solve the world's most pressing problems at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu">University of Colorado</a>'s <a href="http://atlas.colorado.edu">ATLAS Institute</a>. I've also recently become involved in research at <a href="http://epic.cs.colorado.edu">Project EPIC</a>.</p>

<p>Across all <a href="/research">my work</a>, I try to find ways to better understand people in order to help facilitate a more fair and just world.</p>

<p>I live in the beautiful state of Colorado with my amazing wife and incredibly drooly cat. I love finding efficient ways to address inefficiencies. I love spending the day with a cup of coffee learning about anything and everything. Sometimes I think I should go outside more.</p>
